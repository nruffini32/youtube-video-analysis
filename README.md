# Youtube Video Statistics Data Science Project
This project is an exploration of Youtube Statistics using Machine Learning. 
It goes through the data analysis process as a whole: initial EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, and creating the ML model.

### Purpose
The purpose of analyzing this dataset was to explore what makes a "good" video and see if we could predict whether a video
performed well or poorly based on its video and comment statistics. A good video and a bad video were determined besed upon its
like to view ratio ( like_conversion_rate ). We thought this would be the best way to determine the quality of the video because
it does depend on viral status or high view count to determine the quality of the video. Before we began the project we knew we
would have some limitations with the dataset and would need more metrics to fit an accurate model. For example, we knew that you
can only like a video once where as you can watch the video multiple times. With that being said, another one of our goals was to be
able to add features that are highly correlated to like_conversion_rate to the dataset that would help improve the overall
accuracy of our model and assist in determining what is a good, nuetral, or bad video.
